# NPM Scripts
Nuggets on how to use NPM Scripts as your build tool. You don't need Grunt or Gulp anymore.

# Why NPM Scripts
* Cut down on dependencies
* Always up to date
* No need to learn extra plugins

# Invoke commands
NPM provides a couple of shorthands for invoking commands.
To list all commands in package.json run ```npm run```
```
# Start shorthand
$ npm start
$ npm run
$ npm run start

# Test shorthands
$ npm run test
$ npm test
$ npm tst
$ npm t

# Other shorthands
$ npm stop
$ npm restart

# Custom
$ npm run myscript
```
